# Rotation group so3

* Lie algebra, linear space of the same dimension as the Lie group
* closed under a bilinear alternating product called the Lie bracket
* Lie algebra consists of all $3\times 3$ skew-symmetry matrices
* as for the Lie algebra of every matrix group, given by the matrix commutator, $[A_1,A_2]=A_1A_2-A_2A_1$, which is again a skew-symmetric matrix
